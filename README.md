Solarized Minimal
=================

Solarized Minimal is a color theme for [SublimeText][] using the [Solarized][]
palette.

It is minimal in the sense that it attempts to assign styles primarily to the
root groups described in the [TextMate documentation][grammar].

The tmTheme files are generated from the [YAML][] files in `src` using
[yamltotm][].
